# Scientific-Visualization

This is the repo for the scientific visualization projects.

Project 1: The basic goal of this project is to implement a 1-D version of a fundamental abstraction in scientific visualization: a continuous function. The function is reconstructed by convolving a continuous reconstruction kernel with discretely sampled data located somewhere in world-space. With that abstraction implemented, you can generate the simplest kind of scientific visualization: the graph of a function y=f(x).

Project 2: The basic goal of this project is to generalize to two dimensions the abstraction implemented in the first project: a continuous field (reconstructed by convolution with discretely sampled data) that may be evaluated and differentiated at arbitrary points in world-space. To look at the results of the convolution, we use colormaps and some simple shading. 

Project 3: The goal of this project is to build a multi-threaded direct volume renderer. We combine 3D convolution with elements of graphics (a simple camera model, the over operator, and Blinn-Phong shading) to complete a tool that can make high-quality renderings of volume (3D image) datasets.

Project 4: The goal of this project is to implement 2-D vector field convolution, streamline integration, and Line Integral Convolution (LIC).

Note: Due to the copyright reserved by University of Chicago, only code files written by myself and those final generated graphs are pushed to this repo.
